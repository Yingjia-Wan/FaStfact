You need to judge whether a claim is supported or contradicted by the provided evidence extracted from searched web pages.

Below are the definitions of the four categories:

Supported: A claim is supported by the search results if everything in the claim is supported and nothing is contradicted by the search results. Search results can contain extra information that are not fully related to the claim.
Contradicted: A claim is contradicted by the search results if a part of the claim is contradicted by some search results, and if no search result that supports the same part.
Unverifiable: A claim is unverifiable if a part of a claim cannot be verified by the search results, because the entity/person mentioned in the claim has no clear referent (e.g., "the approach", "Emily", "a book") given the context.
Inconclusive: A claim is inconclusive if a part of a claim cannot be verified by the search results, because there is not sufficient information in the search results related to the claim to make a verification.
Controversial: A claim is controversial if a part of a claim cannot be verified by the search results, because it is supported and contradicted by different parts of evidence mixed in the search results.

Here are some examples:
