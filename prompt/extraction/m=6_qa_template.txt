You are trying to verify how factual a response to a question or request is. To do so, you need to perform the following two steps.

First, break down a text between <SOS> and <EOS>, and extract as many atomic factual claims mentioned in the text as possible. An atomic factual claim should be verifiable against reliable external world knowledge (e.g., via Wikipedia). Any story, personal experiences, hypotheticals (e.g., "would be" or subjunctive), subjective statements (e.g., opinions), suggestions, advice, instructions, and other such content should not be extracted. Note that biographical, historical, scientific, and other such information are not personal experiences or stories, so they should be extracted. Each extracted claim should be describing a single event (e.g., "Nvidia is founded in 1993 in Sunnyvale, California, U.S."), single state (e.g., "UMass Amherst has existed for 161 years."), or a concrete piece of information (e.g., "A typical human diploid cell contains 46 chromosomes (23 pairs)."). Quotations should be extracted verbatim with the source when available.
For the first step, extract as much factual claims as possible by focusing on the specific named entities and numbers in each sentence of the text between <EOS> and <SOS>. Each factual claim should be accurate and meaningful on its own and require no additional context. This means that each claim must be situated within relevant temporal information and location whenever available, and all entities in the claim must be referred to by name but not pronoun. Use the name of entities (e.g., 'Edward Jenner') rather than definite noun phrases (e.g., 'the doctor') whenever possible. If a definite noun phrase has to be used, add contextual modifiers so it is independently identifiable. Keep each claim as one sentence with at most one embedded clause.
You do not need to justify what you extract. Simply extract the atomic factual claims following the requirements, regardless of claim correctness. If there is no extractable claim in the sentence, simply write "No verifiable claim.".

Second, act as an evaluator and verify each extracted claim. You should first check whether each extracted claim is relevant in answering the provided question. A claim is irrelevant if it describes completely off-topic things that are unrelated to the question. If the claim is irrelevant, simply label it as IRRELEVANT; If the claim is relevant, continue to verify the factual correctness of the claim with respect to the real world based on your own knowledge. 
For the second step, choose one out of the following labels for each factual claim: 
If a claim is completely irrelevant to the provided question, label it as IRRELEVANT;
If a claim is relevant to the question and you are fully confident it is factually incorrect (e.g., "The Earth orbits around the Moon."), label it as FALSE; 
If a claim is relevant to the question and you are fully confident it is true and factually accurate (e.g., "The Earth orbits around the Sun."), label it as TRUE; 
If a claim is relevant to the question and it is likely true, label it as LIKELY TRUE;
If a claim is relevant to the question and it is likely false, label it as LIKELY FALSE;
If a claim is relevant to the question, but you are unsure of its factual correctness, or if the claim is equivocal or controversial that requires further evidence, label it as UNSURE.
Write your decision right after the corresponding fact in the same line and surround the label with ### signs. If there is no verifiable claim extracted in the first step, no labeling needs to be done.
