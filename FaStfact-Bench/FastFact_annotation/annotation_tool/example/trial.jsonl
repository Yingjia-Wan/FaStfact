The singer-songwriter will be among the nominees at the 81st edition of the TV and film awards, which take place in Beverly Hills this weekend. Which Golden Globe has Swift been nominated for? Swift\u2019s Eras Tour movie, which chronicles part of her ongoing worldwide concert tour, is one of eight films that have been nominated for the Cinematic and Box Office Achievement award. The other contenders for the prize are: Barbie; Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3; John Wick: Chapter 4; Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part 1; Oppenheimer; Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse; and The Super Mario Bros Movie. One of two award categories that will be making their debuts at the 2024 Golden Globes, the Cinematic and Box Office Achievement accolade is contested by the year\u2019s highest-grossing movies. Is this Swift\u2019s first Golden Globes nomination? No, this is the fifth Golden Globes nod of Swift\u2019s career. The 34-year-old has been in the running for the Best Original Song award on four occasions.\n\nEvidence 4\nSource Title: Taylor Swift - Golden Globes\nContent: the Weekly Globe newsletter.

{"question": "Why do the giant planets rotate so much faster than the terrestrial planets in our solar system?", "prompt_source": "factcheck-bench", "response": "The faster rotation of giant planets compared to terrestrial planets in our solar system can be attributed to several interrelated factors rooted in their formation processes and physical characteristics:\n\n1. **Angular Momentum from Accretion**: \n   - **Giant Planets**: Formed farther from the Sun in colder regions, they accreted large amounts of gas and ices from the protoplanetary disk. This material orbited the Sun with higher specific angular momentum (angular momentum per unit mass) due to Keplerian dynamics, where outer disk material moves slower but has a larger orbital radius, resulting in greater angular momentum. As this material spiraled into the forming giants, it transferred significant angular momentum to their rotation.\n   - **Terrestrial Planets**: Closer to the Sun, they formed from rocky planetesimals with less volatile material. Their accretion involved more chaotic collisions, which could cancel out angular momentum contributions, leading to slower net rotation.\n\n2. **Efficiency of Gas Accretion**:\n   - Gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn accreted gas in a coherent, disk-like manner, where infalling material shared a preferred rotational direction. This organized inflow efficiently spun up the planets, unlike the stochastic collisions of solids that built terrestrial planets.\n\n3. **Conservation of Angular Momentum**:\n   - During collapse, a contracting cloud conserves angular momentum, spinning faster as it shrinks. Giant planets, forming from larger, more massive regions of the disk, accumulated more angular momentum overall, despite their larger radii.\n\n4. **Post-Formation Effects**:\n   - **Tidal Braking**: Terrestrial planets, especially those close to the Sun (e.g., Mercury, Venus), experienced stronger tidal interactions that slowed their rotation over time. Giant planets, being farther out, were less affected by solar tides.\n   - **Impacts**: Large collisions (e.g., Earth\u2019s Moon-forming impact) altered terrestrial planets' rotation, while giants, with their massive gravity wells, likely avoided such disruptive events post-formation.\n\n5. **Mass and Radius Considerations**:\n   - Although angular momentum \\( L = I\\omega \\) depends on moment of inertia \\( I \\) (proportional to mass \\( M \\) and radius \\( R^2 \\)), giants' immense mass and acquired angular momentum dominate, resulting in higher rotational speeds (\\( \\omega \\)) despite their larger sizes.\n\nIn summary, the giant planets\u2019 rapid rotation stems from their formation in regions with high angular momentum material, efficient gas accretion processes, and minimal post-formation rotational braking, contrasting with the terrestrial planets\u2019 more chaotic accretion and stronger tidal influences.", "model": "DeepSeek-R1", "abstained": false, "claims_lst": [{"claim_id": "75fe72-0", "claim": "Giant planets form farther from the Sun in colder regions compared to terrestrial planets.", "pre-label": "supported"}, {"claim_id": "005001-1", "claim": "Giant planets accreted large amounts of gas and ices from the protoplanetary disk.", "pre-label": "supported"}, {"claim_id": "7c8be1-2", "claim": "Material in the outer regions of the protoplanetary disk moves slower but has a larger orbital radius.", "pre-label": "supported"}, {"claim_id": "ebae0c-3", "claim": "The angular momentum of material that formed giant planets is higher due to Keplerian dynamics.", "pre-label": "supported"}, {"claim_id": "a0aeb1-4", "claim": "Terrestrial planets formed from rocky planetesimals.", "pre-label": "supported"}, {"claim_id": "977025-5", "claim": "The accretion of terrestrial planets involved more chaotic collisions compared to giant planets.", "pre-label": "supported"}, {"claim_id": "b54db0-6", "claim": "Gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn accreted gas in a coherent, disk-like manner.", "pre-label": "supported"}, {"claim_id": "f171f4-7", "claim": "Infalling material shared a preferred rotational direction when gas giants accreted gas.", "pre-label": "supported"}, {"claim_id": "9ec33d-8", "claim": "Tidal interactions have slowed the rotation of terrestrial planets.", "pre-label": "supported"}, {"claim_id": "3c5977-9", "claim": "Giant planets experienced less tidal interaction due to being farther from the Sun.", "pre-label": "supported"}, {"claim_id": "58994c-10", "claim": "The conservation of angular momentum causes a contracting cloud to spin faster as it shrinks.", "pre-label": "supported"}, {"claim_id": "58e645-11", "claim": "Giant planets form from larger, more massive regions of the protoplanetary disk.", "pre-label": "supported"}, {"claim_id": "a0f199-12", "claim": "The moment of inertia of a planet is proportional to its mass and radius squared.", "pre-label": "supported"}, {"claim_id": "0b4d19-13", "claim": "The immense mass of giant planets and their acquired angular momentum results in higher rotational speeds.", "pre-label": "supported"}], "prelabel_stats": {"supported": 14, "unsupported": 0, "irrelevant": 0, "unsure": 0}, "token_stats": {"extract": {"prompt_tok_cnt": 2407, "response_tok_cnt": 279}, "search": 0, "verify": {"prompt_tok_cnt": 0, "response_tok_cnt": 0}}, "response_stats": {"num_sentences": 19, "length": 382, "preverification": {"directly_preverified_claims": 14, "pre_supported_claims": 14, "pre_unsupported_claims": 0, "pre_irrelevant_claims": 0, "pre_unsure_claims": 0}, "verification": {"total_verified_claims": 0, "verified_supported_claims": 0, "verified_contradicted_claims": 0, "verified_controversial_claims": 0, "verified_inconclusive_claims": 0, "verified_unverifiable_claims": 0, "verified_unsupported_claims": 0}, "total": {"total_claims": 14, "total_supported_claims": 14, "total_unsupported_claims": 0, "total_irrelevant_claims": 0}, "P": 1.0}, "question_id": 1}
